I love building software.

Over the years, I've crashed and burned on numerous occasions. We all do, it's
just a part of being an Software Engineer. Through these mistakes, I've learned
an awful lot about what to do and, more importantly, what not to do.

Coding ProTips is about sharing these experiences and lessons in the hopes that
you can blaze your own trails and make new mistakes.
